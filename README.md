### Hi there 👋 


<!-- **krishaiquin/krishaiquin** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

- 👩 I'm a 3rd year Computer Science student @ UBC
- 🔭 I’m currently working on a timecard desktop application as an introductory project on GUI development using PyQT
- 🌱 Although I am learning desktop app development at the moment, I am slowly starting to learn web app development as well. The technologies I am currently focusing on are Python, HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- 📫 You can reach me @ krishaiquin@gmail.com
